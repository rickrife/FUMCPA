### Procedure  
The following steps assume and the sanctuary building heating system is in summer mode or off and that that the “boiler” is in a cold state.  

**Mixing Room (The room between rooms 67 and 69.)**
- Fully open recirculation louvers.	
- Close fresh air makeup louvers so that a small amount of outside air enters from the lower louvers.	
- Verify that air filters from mixing room to room 67 are in their correct positions.  Address any filter issues before proceeding.	

**Room 65 – Main Mechanical Room**  
Activate Panel P heating system breakers as follows.  
•	13-15-17  
•	19-21-23  
•	14-16-18  
•	20-22-24	
Activate Panel A heating system breakers.  
•	Activate heater zones as labeled in the panel.	

**Room 71 – “Boiler” Room**  
If necessary, add water to achieve a tank pressure of 9 psi indicated.  Open the water supply valve a small amount and check the indicated pressure on the top of the tank.  You must close the water valve to get a stable pressure reading. 
•	NOTES: The normal system pressure is 11 to 12 psi when at operating temperature.  Due to water expansion, the system pressure will increase as the water heats up from ambient temperature to the system temperature of about 170 F.  Setting the cold pressure at 9 psi allows for this pressure increase.	
Verify that the recirculation pump thermostat has functioning batteries.  Activate heat mode on the thermostat.  Increase the controlling thermostat temperature if necessary to cause the thermostat to activate the “heat” function.  
•	If the Sensi thermostat has been off for a time, it may need to reconnect to the network to update the time and other settings.  Reconnection steps are not covered in this procedure. 
•	The thermostat for the recirculation pump acts as a programmable timer for the recirculation pump. It does not control a measured system temperature.  The high and low temperature settings are used to turn the pump on and off at scheduled times.	  
•	Activate the recirculation pump Variable Frequency Drive pump controller by pressing the “auto” button.  The “auto” button will illuminate when activated.  The recirculation pump will ramp up to operating speed over 90 seconds or more.	  
Power on the “boiler” control and active heat mode by turning the switch to the “I” or “1” position.
•	The “boiler” controller will activate the gas burner after a start-up delay or more than a minute or two.  The boiler will heat the water in the boiler and the recirculation loop.  This will take about 1 hour of run time.  This start-up procedure reduces thermal cycling of the “boiler” by heating the water in the boiler and the recirculation loop at the same time.
•	Verify that the “boiler” controller has activated the gas burner and that no start up error occurred.  (It is possible to see the blue flame of the burning gas using the site glass located at the far end of the tank next to the recirculation pump.
•	Verify that the set temperature is 172 F.	
NOTES:
•	With a set temperature of 172 F, the boiler turns on at around 164 F and then it turns off at around 182 F.
•	Setting the temperature at less than 172 F does not save money.  It is very important that the exhaust gasses vented up the exhaust stack stay hot enough to prevent condensation in the vent stack.  Condensation in the vent stack will rapidly corrode the vent stack metal and result in a very costly repair.	

**Room 67 – Supply Fan S-1**
Visually verify that 2 belts are present on the fan motor.  If one belt is broken, the system can run temporarily with one working belt if necessary.  Spare belts are usually stored on a hook in the room.  Replace both belts at the same time.	
Activate the fan motor controller.   Activate auto mode.	

**Room 69 – Recirculation Fan**
- Visually verify that the belt are present on the fan motor.  If one belt is broken, the system can run temporarily with one working belt if necessary.  Spare belts are usually stored on a hook in the room.  Replace both belts at the same time.	
- Activate the fan motor controller.   Activate auto mode.	

**Room 83 (Mechanical Room accessible from Memorial Garden)**
- Activate controllers for Chancel (H9) and Kohlstedt Hall (H5).  Activate auto mode.	

**Sanctuary**
There are 2 thermostats in the sanctuary, one on the main floor and one on the Chancel area.  Each thermostat controls a separate fan unit.  The thermostats are programmable. 
 At the time of creation of this procedure, both thermostats are programmable remotely using a Wi-Fi connected application.  The programming process is not covered in this document.
- Activate the Chancel thermostat in heating mode.  Change batteries if needed.	
- Activate the Sanctuary thermostat in heating mode.  Change batteries if needed.	

**Room 71 – “Boiler” Room**
- Verify that “boiler” is up to operating temperature.  
- Verify that the system water pressure is 12 psi.  Add or remove water if needed to achieve 12 psi.
